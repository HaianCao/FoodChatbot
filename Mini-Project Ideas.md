## Some Ideas

Below are some ideas for a AI-related project. You can pick what you like from here or suggest your own ideas. Please note that you don't have to solve the whole problem or implement all features at once; you can start small and expand your project gradually. Small contributions are welcome! You can even take a solved problem, re-examine it (e.g., by re-implementing it and verifying the known results), and explain how it works.
