    "Teresa Frizzell says:Where can I buy toffee bits? Or can I make them?",
    "Alyssa Rivers says:Hi Teresa, I am not sure where you are located, but I usually just get them from my local grocery store in the baking section. Here is a link on amazon. You could also make homemade toffee if you’d like.",
    "Laura L Aubuchon says:Can I double this recipe and just use a cookie sheet or do I need to make 2 batches?",
    "Alyssa Rivers says:You should be able to double it in a cookie sheet!",
    "Leslie says:These are so easy to make and so easy to eat!  It doesn’t get any easier to assemble and bake, you just have to be patient to cut into them, as it takes a few hours for them to set up. I couldn’t stop eating them!"
