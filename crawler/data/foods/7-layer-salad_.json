    "Angelina says:Love this type of Salad, and it’s very close to the one I’ve been making.  The recipe I have calls for a good quality mayo, which can be mixed with a favorite dressing (if desired), or U can just use Miracle Whip.  It’s pretty & delicious, any way you decide to make it.  Best served in a Trifile dish, but U can use a pretty & deep glass salad bowl, as well."
