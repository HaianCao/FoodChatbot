    "Teresa Winkle says:This was delicious made this 04/29/23 for supper the only thing a little different was using smoked paprika. 13 minutes at 390 was perfect!!",
    "Vi says:Can you use frozen cauliflower florets?",

    "Shelly says:Do you preheat the air fryer or just put the caulif. in and then start at 390?",
    "Alyssa Rivers says:I preheat the air fryer before adding in the cauliflower. Enjoy!!",
    "Lori says:Thanks for the air fryer help. I used a rotisserie basket so I didn’t put the Parmesan on till it was cooked. I’ve never liked cauliflower until tonight. It was excellent. I will try other vegetables this way too.",
