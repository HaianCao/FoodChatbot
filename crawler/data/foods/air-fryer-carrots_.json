    "Dawn says:I liked these, my husband did not care for them. He’ll usually eat his food even if it’s not something he cares for, these he threw away, a very rare thing for him to do. Which is sad for me, since it’s just the two of us, I won’t be making again.",
    "Kelly says:When you said they were like French fries, I was like, “ yea, right”These are better than fries! My husband and I couldn’t wait for them to cool off. We ate all of them! Thanks so much for helping us eat more veg in the new year?",
    "Stephanie says:These were so delicious, definitely making again. I almost had all the ingredients on hand except the carrots. It doesn’t really specify, but I used fresh parmesan cheese that I had from another recipe. Next time I would use less olive oil. Like a 1/4 less because there was a lot left over except that just allowed my brother to use the rest to coat his air fryer French fries. I might try making these in the oven next time on a baking sheet. Also I missed the step where the dressing was poured over the carrots and then tossed not the other way around so I mixed the carrots into the dressing. I think your way would work better, so I’ll do that next time. This went excellent with pre-cooked blackened chicken alfredo that I only had to heat on the stove. I took bites of both together and somehow made both taste even better.",
    "Carol says:Going to try the airfreight carrots",
    "Lisa says:Easy & Delicious!!! The only thing I’ll change next time is the quantity,  I’ll definitely be making a bigger batch. The whole family wanted more. 🙂",
    "Carol says:Love this recipe! I had a little of the parmesan/garlic mixture left after coating my carrots, so I thinly sliced a small eggplant I’d brought in from my garden this morning, tossed it in the remaining mixture, and air-fried it. The resulting ‘chips’ were amazing! I grind my own parmesan so to save time, I’ve tripled the recipe and will store the dry mixture in the fridge to use it on chicken and other vegetables. Thank you!",
    "Erin says:Can you give an amount or a range for the salt and pepper? This is a really important ingredient.",
    "Tom says:We split baby carrots lengthwise. Our air fryer took about 20 minutes, but this recipe is a real keeper. I’m going to use this on sweet potato fries as well!",
    "Gigi says:I love that this doesn’t contain added sugar. I definitely also appreciate the brown sugar take on roasted carrots, but I have a sweet tooth and try my best to save added sugar for less frequent intentional, indulgent desserts 🙂 Thank you for posting this!",
    "Susan says:I made these carrots to go with a roast beef and mashed potatoes— WOW!!! I have never had carrots as good as these!!They will DEFINITELY be on my list to make again (and again, and again!). I told my husband I would be happy just to eat a meal of these Parmesan garlic carrots!I will experiment with oven time (in place if air fryer) so that I can make a huge batch for our next family gathering!  Thanks so much for this recipe! It’s my new favorite side dish!!!",
    "Kimberly Lewis says:This is better than Great! So easy you can fix them for a healthy snack.",
    "Michal says:I am trying to be dairy free so I made them without the Parmesan.  Amazing.  Can’t stop eating them.  And so easy!  Thank you for this amazing recipe!!!",
    "Lisa Swanson says:Quick, easy and delicious!  I cut carrots into sticks like french fries and roasted for 10 minutes."
